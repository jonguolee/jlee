            <p className="intro-text">I am an alum from Texas A&M University '20. Current web developer-in-training with ambition for creative design!</p>

                <h3>Full Stack Development</h3>
                <p>My love for UI/UX design originated from when I owned my first smartphone back in high school, the Samsung Galaxy s3. I am now looking to challenge myself in the field of web development and design with the goal of developing web applications. </p>

                <h3>My Greatest Passion</h3>
                <p>Despite my passion for exploring the ins and outs of web development, there is perhaps nothing I feel stronger about than the dislike for pineapple on pizza. The only "yellow" attribute that belongs on a pizza is a hefty layer of fresh cheese. </p>
